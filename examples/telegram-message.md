## 📈 ROUTE 1: Linea 2× Boost (Most Efficient)

**Rate:** 1.6 pts/$1 | **Fee:** 0.85% per swap

| Level | Tier | Total Pts | This Level | Cumul Cost | Cumul Fee | Reward | Net |

|-------|------|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|--------|-----|

| **L1** | Frontier | 1K | 750 pts / $469 | $469 | $4 | $14 | **+$10** ✓ |

| **L2** | Sylvana* | 25K | 24K pts / $15K | $15,469 | $131 | $357 | **+$226** ✓ |

| **L3** | Oceania | 50K | 25K pts / $15.6K | $31,094 | $264 | $714 | **+$450** ✓ |

| **L4** | Denalia* | 100K | 50K pts / $31.3K | $62,344 | $530 | $1,428 | **+$898** ✓ |

| **L5** | Titana | 1M | 900K pts / $562.5K | $624,844 | $5,311 | $14,280 | **+$8,969** ✓ |

| **L6** | Arcadia | 2.5M | 1.5M pts / $937.5K | $1,562,344 | $13,280 | $35,700 | **+$22,420** ✓ |

| **L7** | Utopia | 5M | 2.5M pts / $1.56M | $3,124,844 | $26,561 | $71,400 | **+$44,839** ✓ |

*Has boost window (L2: 24h, L4: 72h) - batch swaps during these for efficiency

**Key insight:** All levels profitable at 1:1 assumption. L4 offers solid balance (~$62K investment).

## 📈 ROUTE 2: Base Rate (No Linea Boost)

**Rate:** 0.8 pts/$1 | **Fee:** 0.85% per swap

| Level | Tier | Cumul Cost | Cumul Fee | Reward | Net |

|-------|------|------------|-----------|--------|-----|

| L1 | Frontier | $938 | $8 | $14 | **+$6** ✓ |

| L2 | Sylvana | $30,938 | $263 | $357 | **+$94** ✓ |

| L4 | Denalia | $124,688 | $1,060 | $1,428 | **+$368** ✓ |

| L7 | Utopia | $6,249,688 | $53,122 | $71,400 | **+$18,278** ✓ |

**Reality:** 2× the cost vs Linea route. Still profitable at 1:1, but less efficient.

## ⚡ ROUTE 3: Perps (High Volume)

**Rate:** 0.1 pts/$1 notional volume | **No fees**

| Level | Tier | Volume Needed | Reward |

|-------|------|---------------|--------|

| L1 | Frontier | $7,500 | $14 |

| L4 | Denalia | $997,500 | $1,428 |

| L7 | Utopia | $49,997,500 | $71,400 |

**Reality check:** $50M volume for L7. Only for pro traders with capital efficiency.

## 🤔 Understanding "Proportional to Points"

**What MetaMask said:** "Linea token allocation proportional to your total points"

### Our Interpretation (What We Calculate)

• **1 point = 1 LINEA token** (direct conversion)

• Simple, calculable, gives clear ROI

• This is what all our tables show

### Alternative Interpretation (Pool Share)

• $30M pool ÷ total community points

• Your share = (Your Points / Everyone's Points) × $30M

• **Problem:** Can't calculate without knowing total points

**Example pool share scenario:**

- 100 billion total community points

- You have 100K points (0.0001%)

- Your share: $30

**Our approach:** Model 1:1 as baseline. It's calculable and gives users a framework. Actual mechanics TBD.

## ⏱️ Boost Window Strategy

**L2 Sylvana (25K pts unlock):**

• 24-hour 50% boost on swaps/perps

• Strategy: Batch next 24K points immediately after unlock

• Timing critical: Plan your L2→L3 climb during this window

**L4 Denalia (100K pts unlock):**

• 72-hour 50% boost

• Strategy: Save capital, batch swaps in this 3-day window

• Best for: Pushing toward L5

**Note:** Boosts apply to points earned AFTER reaching the level.

## 🧭 Decision Framework by Capital

### 🦐 Small (<$20K)

**Target:** L1-L2

**Rationale:** Qualify for airdrop, minimal commitment

**Cost:** ~$15K for L2

### 🐟 Mid ($20K-$70K)

**Target:** L3-L4

**Rationale:** Balance risk/reward, access boosts

**Cost:** $31K-$62K

**Sweet spot if 1:1 holds**

### 🐋 Large ($70K-$700K)

**Target:** L4-L5

**Rationale:** Serious ecosystem positioning

**Cost:** Up to $625K for L5

### 🦈 Whale ($700K+)

**Target:** L6-L7

**Rationale:** Long-term LINEA/Ethereum thesis

**AlphaFoxes Club + Metal Card perks**

**Cost:** $1.56M-$3.1M
