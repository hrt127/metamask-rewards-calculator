3. Your view on LINEA long-term

**Our baseline:** Model 1:1 (1 point = 1 LINEA token) for calculable framework.

## 🎲 The Two Conversion Scenarios

### Scenario A: Direct 1:1 (What we calculate)

**Assumption:** 1 point = 1 LINEA token

**Your allocation:** Points earned = LINEA tokens received

**Pros:**

- Simple, predictable

- All levels profitable

- Clear ROI calculation

**Cons:**

- Not confirmed by MetaMask

- Could overshoot if total points are lower

---

### Scenario B: Proportional Pool Share

**Assumption:** Your share of $30M pool based on % of total points

**Your allocation:** (Your Points / Total Community Points) × $30M

**Pros:**

- More likely official interpretation

- Balanced regardless of total participation

**Cons:**

- Can't calculate without knowing total

- Lower payout if many farmers

**Example:**

- Total: 100 billion community points

- You: 100K points (0.0001%)

- Allocation: 0.0001% × $30M = **$30** (vs $1,428 at 1:1)

## 🧮 Route Comparison

### Linea 2× Boost (Recommended)

**Efficiency:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Cost per point:** ~$0.625

**Best for:** Most farmers, highest efficiency

**Trade-off:** Must use Linea chain for swaps

---

### Base Rate

**Efficiency:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

**Cost per point:** ~$1.25 (2× higher)

**Best for:** Users avoiding Linea for other reasons

**Trade-off:** Double the capital needed

---

### Perps Route

**Efficiency:** ⭐ (1/5 for swaps-only)

**Cost per point:** ~$10 in volume

**Best for:** Existing perps traders with capital efficiency

**Trade-off:** Massive volume requirements, liquidation risk

---

## ⚡ Optimization Strategy

**Phase 1: Reach L2 (24K points)**

- Use Linea for all swaps (1.6 pts/$1)

- Batch $15K of volume

- **Unlock:** 24h boost window

---

**Phase 2: Use L2 Boost**

- Immediately batch next 24K points during boost

- Boost rate: 2.4 pts/$1 (0.8 base × 2 Linea × 1.5 boost)

- **Reach:** L3 efficiently

---

**Phase 3: Push to L4**

- Continue Linea route: 1.6 pts/$1

- Total additional: $19K swap volume

- **Unlock:** 72h boost window

---

**Phase 4: Strategic Decision**

**Option A: Use L4 Boost for L5**

- Batch 900K points during 72h boost

- Boost rate: 2.4 pts/$1

- Cost: $375K during boost

- **L5 reward:** $14,280

- **Net:** +$8,969 at 1:1

**Option B: Stop at L4**

- Take $1,428 reward

- Lock in +$898 profit at 1:1

- Preserve capital for other opportunities

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Linea boost is essential** - 2× efficiency vs base

2. **Boost windows matter** - Plan capital deployment around them

3. **L4 is sweet spot** - Best effort/reward balance for most

4. **Conversion unclear** - Model 1:1 but prepare for pool share reality

5. **Capital efficiency** - Not a "free money" situation

## 📚 Decision Tree

```
Start: Do you have capital for L1-L7 farming?

├─ Yes, any amount

│  └─ Are you willing to use Linea chain?

│     ├─ Yes → Use Linea 2× route (best efficiency)

│     │       

│     │       How much capital?

│     │       ├─ <$20K → Target L1-L2

│     │       ├─ $20K-70K → Target L3-L4 (sweet spot)

│     │       ├─ $70K-700K → Target L4-L5

│     │       └─ >$700K → Target L6-L7

│     │

│     └─ No → Use base route (accept 2× cost)

│

└─ No capital or neutral on LINEA

   └─ Skip farming, or wait for clarification
```

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**

✓ L1-L2: Minimal capital, potential upside

✓ All calculations transparent

✓ No smart contract risk (MetaMask native)

**Medium Risk:**

⚠️ Conversion rate unknown

⚠️ LINEA price volatility

⚠️ 90-day commitment window

**High Risk:**

⚠️ Large capital outlay ($50K+)

⚠️ Pool share scenario could cut rewards significantly

⚠️ Sybil measures could disqualify multi-wallet

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Should you farm?**

**Maybe, if:**

- You're bullish on LINEA

- You have capital you can deploy

- You accept conversion uncertainty

- You're comfortable with swap fees

**Probably skip if:**

- You're bearish on LINEA

- Can't afford capital commitment

- Prefer confirmed airdrop mechanics

- More attractive opportunities elsewhere
